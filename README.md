# FRACTALS
This is a collection of all of my fractal related programs.
Here you can find:
  -Buddhabrot: Renderings of the Buddhabrot which is a method of rendering the mandelbrot set.
   see images for examples of this and it's results.
   
  -FractalTree: A simple fractal tree applet that allows you to explore the fabulousness of 
   fractal trees.
